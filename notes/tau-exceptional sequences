\section{\tu-exceptional sequences}
In representation theory, exceptional sequences were originally introduced for hereditary algebras\cite{cbw92}\cite{ringel_exceptional} as certain sequences of modules. Later, Buan and Marsh introduced \tu-exceptional sequences\cite{buantau2020} for all finite dimensional algebras. For an hereditary algebra, its (unsigned) \tu-exceptional sequences corresponds to its exceptional sequences. In this section, we briefly introduce \tu-exceptional sequences. 

We follow the notation of \cite{buantau2020}. Let $\mathcal{C}(A) = \{M \oplus N[1] : M,N \in \text{mod} A\} \subseteq \mathcal{D}^b(\text{mod} A)$. For a full subcategory $D \subseteq \text{mod} A$, let $\mathcal{C} = {M \oplus N[i] : M,N \in D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}(A)$.

Much helped by Jasso reduction and basic properties of 2-term silting objects, we may define signed \tu-exceptional sequences as below.

\begin{definition}
	A list $(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_{t-1},U_t)$ of indecomposable objects in $\mathcal{C}(A)$ of length $t$ is a called a signed \tu-exceptional sequence if $U_t$ is $\tu$-rigid in $\mathcal{C}(A)$ and $(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_{t-1})$ is a signed \tu-exceptional sequence of length $t-1$ in $J(U_t)$. Note that exceptional sequences of length $1$ in $\text{mod } B$ are simply lists $(U)$ where $U$ is an indecomposable \tu-rigid object in $\text{mod } B$.
\end{definition} 

A \tu-exceptional sequence $(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_t)$ is called \textit{unsigned} if none of the $U_i$ are shifted projectives in their appropriate ambient category. We remark that by \tu-exceptional sequences we refer to the whole set of both signed and unsigned \tu-exceptional sequences.

Further, Buan and Marsh show that there is a bijection between the set of \tu-exceptional sequences of lenght $t$ and the set of ordered \tu-rigid objects with $t$ summands. In particular, the set of complete (that is, length $n$) \tu-exceptional sequences corresponds to ordered \tu-tilting modules.


\subsection{Unsigned \tu-exceptional sequences}
Given the bijection between ordered \tu-rigid objects of $A$ and \tu-exceptional sequences of $A$, one may ask which \tu-rigid objects correspond to unsigned \tu-exceptional sequences. Not only is this a natural question to ask given the definition of \tu-exceptional sequences, but since unsigned complete exceptional sequences for hereditary algebras enjoy particularly nice properties (see for example \cite{ringel_exceptional}), one may ask to which extent we may recover these properties in the general case.

Mendoza and Treffinger\cite{mendoza2020stratifying} solved this by showing that under the mentioned bijection, so-called \textit{TF-admissibly ordered)} or simply \textit{TF-ordered} \tu-rigid modules correspond exactly to unsigned \tu-exceptional sequences. We now recall this and related results, and discuss how we employ these results to algorithimcally study the set of unsigned \tu-exceptional sequences.

\begin{definition}\cite{mendoza2020stratifying}
	An ordered \tu-rigid module $M_1 \oplus M_2 \oplus \dots \oplus M_i$ is called TF-ordered if no $M_i$ is generated by the direct sum of the $M_j$ where $j > i$. More precisely, we demand that $M_j \notin \text{Fac}(\bigoplus_{k = j+1}^i M_k)$ for all $1 \leq j \leq i$.
\end{definition}

We now state the main result of \cite{mendoza2020stratifying}.

\begin{theorem}\cite{mendoza2020stratifying}\label{tf-to-tau}
	Let $M_1 \oplus M_2 \oplus \dots \oplus M_i$ be TF-ordered. Denote by $f_j$ the torsion-free functor associated to the torsion pair induced by $\text{Fac}(\bigoplus_{k = j+1}^i M_k)$.
	
	Then, $(f_1(M_1),f_2(M_2),\dots,f_i(M_i))$ is an unsigned \tu-exceptional sequences, and all unsigned \tu-exceptional sequences arise in this way.
\end{theorem}

We now discuss some combinatorial properties of TF-ordered modules.

Mendoza and Treffinger demonstrate that in fact all \tu-rigid modules admit a TF ordering. They also proved that for a TF-ordered \tu-rigid object $X = \oplus_{j = 1}^i X_i$, if $B \oplus X$ is its Bongartz-completion then any ordering on the form \[(X_1,\dots,X_i,B_{\sigma(1)},\dots,B_{\sigma(n-i)})\]
Is also TF. This implies, since the Bongartz completion of the $0$ module is $A$, that there are $n!$ TF-orderings of $A$. 

\begin{example}
	It is not the case that every \tu-exceptional module has $k!$ TF-admissible orderings for an integer $k$. It is also not the case that left mutation must not increase the number of TF-admissible orderings.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}
	Given a TF-ordered partial \tu-tilting module, $X = X_1 \oplus X_2 \oplus \dots \oplus X_i$, it may be extended to a TF-ordering of a \tu-tilting module $Y_1 \oplus \dots \oplus Y_{n-i} \oplus X_1 \oplus \dots X_i$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	By the Buan-Marsh correspondence, $X$ corresponds to an unsigned \tu-exceptional sequence of length $i$, say $U = (U_1,U_2,\dots,U_i)$. $J(U_1)$ may be considered a module category for an algebra with $n - i$ simple modules. Since every algebra has unsigned, complete \tu-exceptional sequences, we may extend $U$ to a complete $\tu$-exceptional sequence, say \[W = (W_1, \dots,  W_{n-i},  U_1, \dots, U_i)\] 
	
	This \tu-exceptional sequence again corresponds to a TF-ordered \tu-tilting module $T = T_1 \dots \oplus T_n$.
	
	Since $T_{n-i+1} \oplus \dots \oplus T_{n}$ induces the same \tu-exceptional sequence as $X$, they must be the same orderings of the same modules. This concludes our proof.
	
\end{proof}



For a $\tau$-tilting finite algebra, we may compute all its \tu-rigid modules using mutation of \tu-tilting modules. We may then directly compute all unsigned \tu-exceptional sequences by considering all TF-orderings of \tu-tilting modules and exploiting \cref{tf-to-tau}.

\subsubsection{Mutation of \tu-exceptional sequences}
Buan and Marsh consider in an unpublished note an operation on the set of \tu-exception sequences. We here consider the same operation on the set of complete unsigned \tu-exceptional sequences.

\begin{definition}
	Let $ T = (T_1,T_2,\dots,T_n)$ be an unsigned complete \tu-exceptional sequence. Any unsigned complete \tu-exceptional sequence on the form $T_x = (T_1,T_2,\dots,T_{j-1},T_{j+1},X,T_{j+2},\dots,T_n)$ is called a \textit{right mutation} of $T$ at coordinate $j$. In this case, $T$ is called a  \textit{left mutation} of $T_x$ at coordinate $j$.
\end{definition}

On hereditary algebras, this operation is induced by a transitive Braid group action. We demonstrate below that in the non-hereditary case this operation does not enjoy the same properties.

\begin{definition}
	We define the quiver of complete \tu-exceptional sequences $Q(c\tu \text{-sequence } A)$ as the quiver having a vertex for each complete \tu-exceptional sequence over $A$ and an edge $T_1 \to T_2$ if $T_2$ is a right mutation of $T_1$ at some coordinate.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Let $A$ be a \tu-tilting finite algebra. We say that $A$ is \tu-exceptional transitive if the underlying graph of $Q(c\tu \text{-sequence } A)$ is connected.
\end{definition}



\begin{example}
	We demonstrate that not all \tu-tilting finite algebras are \tu-exceptional transitive, and that right-mutation is not always possible.
	
	Consider the algebra defined by the quiver
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		1 \arrow[r,bend left,"\alpha"] & 2 \arrow[l,bend left,"\alpha"]  \\
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	
	modulo the relations $\alpha^3 = 0$.
	
	This algebra has three $\tau$-tilting modules, $P(1) \oplus P(2)$, $S(2) \oplus P(2)$ and $P(1) \oplus S(1)$. These three modules together induce $4$ TF-admissible orderings, giving us $4$ unsigned complete \tu-exceptional sequences, shown below.
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
			\hline
			TF-admissible ordering & $\tau$-exceptional sequence \\
			\hline
			$P(1),P(2)$ & $S(1),P(2)$ \\ 
			$P(2),P(1)$ & $S(2),P(1)$ \\ 
			$P(2),S(2)$ & $rP(1),S(2)$\\ 
			$P(1),S(1)$ & $rP(2),S(1)$ \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	
	
	Clearly, the only right-mutations of $\tau$-exceptional sequences here are $(rP(1),S(2)) \to (S(2),P(1))$ and $(rP(2),S(1)) \to (S(1),P(2))$. 
\end{example}

We are interested in classifying algebras where the right-mutation of \tu-exceptional is particularly well-behaved. Two conditions to consider are \tu-exceptional transitivity as defined above and when right-mutation is always possible.

\begin{proposition}
	Let $A$ be the algebra defined by the quiver
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		1 \arrow[r,bend left,"\alpha"] & 2 \arrow[l,bend left,"\beta"]  \\
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	
	modulo the relations $r^j = 0$.
	
	Then $A$ is \tu-exceptional transitive if and only if $j$ is even.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	We first demonstrate that TF-admissible sequences over $A$ are essentially independent of the choice of $j$, before studing the \tu-exceptional sequences they induce.
	
	
	Adachi has shown that a \tu-tilting module over a Nakayama algebra has a projective summand. Thus there may not be more than $3$ \tu-tilting modules over a Nakayama algebra with two simples; this follows immediately from the fact that one may only find two mutations of the trivial \tu-tilting module $P(1) \oplus P(2)$ and by the result of Adachi, any \tu-titing module must be a mutation of $P(1) \oplus P(2)$.
	
	We have a map $f:P(1) \to P(2)$ with co-kernel $S(2)$, and a map $g:P(2) \to P(1)$ with co-kernel $S(1)$.
	
	We may use this fact to see that $P(1) \oplus S(1)$ and $P(2) \oplus S(2)$ are \tu-tilting modules. Further,they each admit only one TF-ordering. 
	
	We now consider the case where $j$ is even. In this case, both projective modules have dimension vectors $(j/2,j/2)$. For $P(1)$, the map $\alpha:k^{j/2} \to k^{j/2}$ has no kernel. Thus $\text{Hom}_A(S(1),P(1)) = 0$. Similarly, $\text{Hom}_A(S(2),P(2)) = 0$. Thus, the \tu-exceptional sequence associated to the TF-ordered \tu-tilting modules $P(2),S(2)$ and $P(1),S(1)$ are simply $P(2),S(2)$ and $P(1),S(1)$ respectively. We collect these facts in the table below. 
	
	
	\begin{center}
		
		\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
			\hline
			\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$j \equiv 0 (\text{mod }2)$} \\
			\hline
			TF-admissible ordering & $\tau$-exceptional sequence \\
			\hline
			$P(1),P(2)$ & $S(1),P(2)$ \\ 
			$P(2),P(1)$ & $S(2),P(1)$ \\ 
			$P(2),S(2)$ & $P(1),S(2)$\\ 
			$P(1),S(1)$ & $P(2),S(1)$ \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	Let now $j$ be odd. It is not hard to see that $P(1),P(2)$ and $P(2),P(1)$ will still induce the \tu-exceptional sequences $S(1),P(2)$ and $S(2),P(1)$ respectively. We now compute the \tu-exceptional sequence induced by the TF-ordered module $P(1),S(1)$. Note that the linear map induced by $\alpha$ in $P(1)$ will have a kernel of rank $1$, meaning that $S(1)$ has a nonzero trace in $P(1)$. In fact, the trace of $S(1)$ in $P(1)$ is $\text{soc } P(1)$, giving $P(1)/\text{soc P(1)},S(1)$ as the induced \tu-exceptional sequence. A symmetric argument allows us to compute the \tu-exceptional sequence induced by $P(2),S(2)$. We summarise these findings in the table below.
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
			\hline
			\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$j \equiv 1 (\text{mod }2)$} \\
			\hline
			TF-admissible ordering & $\tau$-exceptional sequence \\
			\hline
			$P(1),P(2)$ & $S(1),P(2)$ \\ 
			$P(2),P(1)$ & $S(2),P(1)$ \\ 
			$P(2),S(2)$ & $P(1)/\text{soc}P(1),S(2)$\\ 
			$P(1),S(1)$ & $P(2)/\text{soc }P(2),S(1)$ \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	We may by inspection see that $A$ is \tu-exceptional transitive only in the case where $j$ is even.
	
\end{proof}
